BUILD CURRENTLY BROKEN

Go bindings for:
Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
http://www.sfml-dev.org/

I am in no way affiliated with SFML.

These bindings are experimental, the API is subject to change and has
only been tested on linux. (Ubuntu 10.4 lucid x86)  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES:

libcsfml 1.5


If you're using Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev      # The SFML headers

~~
libcsfml-dev            - Development files for the C binding of SFML

INSTALLING:

go-sfml$ make install

I hope it works for you, and if it doesn't - please complain over at 
http://github.com/drhodes/go-sfml/issues

Now try out the example in the test directory,

test $ make
test $ ./win-example

You should see a rotating, scaling gopher.
