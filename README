** currently reimplementing with cgo **
BUILD CURRENTLY BROKEN, updating to SFML RC 2.0 with go1
(relative stability, yay!)

Go bindings for:
Simple and Fast Multimedia Library
http://www.sfml-dev.org/

I am in no way affiliated with SFML.

These bindings are experimental, the API is subject to change and has
only been tested on linux. (Ubuntu 10.4 lucid x86)  

_____________________________________________________________________________
DEPENDENCIES:

Both SFML and CSFML libraries are needed, as CSFML links to SFML.

CSFML RC 2.0
SFML RC 2.0
libjpeg 8
libglew 1.7

BASIC LINUX LIBRARY CONFIGURATION

Get the goods if you need them, here:

http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.7.0/glew-1.7.0.tgz/download
http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v8.tar.gz

Under linux I've found that all three of the following environmental variables
to be required.  Through the pernicious windings and labyrinths of archia
reigns the following incantation for thy linkage to bare fruit of object files
in the realm of bash. Beware traveller.

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=${C_INCLUDE_PATH}:/path/to/CSFML-2.0-rc/include
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=${C_INCLUDE_PATH}:/path/to/glew-1.7.0/include
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=${C_INCLUDE_PATH}:/path/to/jpeg-8/build/include

export LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBRARY_PATH}:/path/to/CSFML-2.0-rc/lib
export LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBRARY_PATH}:/path/to/SFML-2.0-rc/lib

INSTALLING:

GIVE IT A WHIRL:

Now try out the example in the test directory,

test $ gomake
test $ ./win-example

You should see a rotating, scaling gopher.
